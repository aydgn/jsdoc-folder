# JSDoc Folder

Automatically collapses JSDoc comment blocks by default when opening JavaScript and TypeScript files.

## Why This Extension?

JSDoc comments can take up significant vertical space in your code editor. Long documentation blocks often make it harder to navigate and understand the actual code structure. This extension solves that problem by automatically folding JSDoc comments while preserving their first line, giving you the best of both worlds:

## Features

- Automatically folds JSDoc comment blocks when opening files
- Preserves the first line (/** */) for visibility
- Supports both JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Configurable through VS Code settings

## Usage

JSDoc comments will be automatically folded when you open a file:

```javascript
/** This line stays visible
 * These lines will be
 * automatically folded
 * when you open the file
 */
function example() {}
```

## Configuration

You can configure the extension through VS Code settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings (âŒ˜, on macOS or Ctrl+, on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for "JSDoc Folder"
3. Find the following settings:

* `jsdocFolder.autoFold`: Enable/disable automatic folding of JSDoc comments
  * `true` (default): Automatically fold JSDoc comments when opening files
  * `false`: Leave JSDoc comments unfolded

You can also directly edit settings.json:
